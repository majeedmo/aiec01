- [MCP Official Docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) — Spec, tutorials, and guides

## Main Assignment

In this session, you will build an MCP server with OAuth authentication — a cat
shop application that exposes tools for browsing products, managing a cart, and
checking out.

The main entry point is:

```text
server.py
```

The server implementation lives in:

```text
app/
```

Available MCP tools:

- `list_products`
- `get_product`
- `add_to_cart`
- `view_cart`
- `remove_from_cart`
- `checkout`

## Setup

From this folder:

```bash
uv sync
```

Copy the example env file and fill in your OpenAI API key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Running the MCP Server

Run the server locally:

```bash
uv run server.py
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:8000`.

### Expose the server with ngrok

In a separate terminal, start an ngrok tunnel:

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

Copy the ngrok forwarding URL (e.g. `https://xxxx-xx-xx-xx-xx.ngrok-free.app`) and
restart the server with it:

```bash
ISSUER_URL=https://xxxx-xx-xx-xx-xx.ngrok-free.app uv run server.py
```

> **Note:** The `ISSUER_URL` must match the public URL clients use to reach the
> server, otherwise OAuth authentication will fail.

## Outline

### Breakout Room #1

- Set up the MCP server with OAuth and the product database
- Explore the MCP tools: `list_products`, `get_product`, `add_to_cart`, `view_cart`, `remove_from_cart`, `checkout`

### Breakout Room #2

- Connect an MCP client to the server
- Build an end-to-end interaction flow using the MCP tools

## Ship

The completed MCP server and client integration!

### Deliverables

- A short Loom of either:
  - the MCP server you built and a demo of the client interacting with it; or
  - the notebook you created for the Advanced Build

## Share

Make a social media post about your final application!

### Deliverables

- Make a post on any social media platform about what you built!

## Submitting Your Homework 

Follow these steps to prepare and submit your homework assignment:

1. Review the MCP server code in `server.py` and the `app/` directory
2. Run the MCP server locally using `uv run server.py`
3. Connect to the server using an MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop, or a custom client)
4. Test all available tools: browsing products, adding to cart, viewing cart, removing items, and checkout
5. Record a Loom video reviewing what you have learned from this session

## Questions

### Question #1

Why is OAuth important for MCP servers, and what security considerations should you keep in mind when exposing tools to AI clients?

#### Answer

As we have seen in our session # 8 demo, MCP tools can read data and change real application state (e.g. cart and checkout). With Streamable HTTP, the server is reachable over the network, so anyone who can hit the URL could invoke those tools unless requests are authenticated.

OAuth answers who is calling and can restrict caller's allowed to do. It ties each tool call to an authenticated user (e.g. cart operations scoped by username from the access token), supports scopes and token revocation, and provides a standard consent flow for remote MCP clients. 

##### Security considerations for AI clients
1. Auth on sensitive tools — Protect state-changing operations; use least-privilege scopes.
2. User data isolation — Ensure users cannot access each other’s carts, orders, or accounts.
3. AI-specific risk — Models may call tools unexpectedly (prompt injection). OAuth limits who is affected; you still need confirmations, narrow tools, and logging for high-impact actions.
4. Validate inputs — Treat tool arguments like untrusted API input.
5. Transport and tokens — Use HTTPS, short-lived tokens, correct ISSUER_URL, and secure client-side token storage.
6. Minimize exposure — Only return data the model truly needs; avoid leaking secrets or excessive PII in tool responses.

### Question #2

What is Streamable HTTP transport in MCP, and why might you expose a server publicly with OAuth instead of using a local stdio connection?

#### Answer

Streamable HTTP: Clients send MCP JSON-RPC messages via HTTP POST to a single endpoint (e.g. /mcp). The server can respond with JSON or upgrade to SSE for streaming. This lets the MCP server run as a shared network service instead of a local subprocess

##### stdio fits when:
stdio = “run this tool on local machine for me”
- The MCP server runs on the same machine as the client (e.g. Claude Desktop spawning a local tool server).
- There’s no network boundary i.e. the OS process model is the trust boundary.
- Local access is implicit, typically don’t need OAuth 

##### Public Streamable HTTP + OAuth fits when:
Streamable HTTP + OAuth = “call this API as a specific user, from anywhere”
- Clients aren’t on the same machine. For example in our excercise ngrok flow (ISSUER_URL=https://....ngrok-free.app) is exactly this: a client anywhere on the internet can reach the server. stdio can’t do that as there’s no URL to connect to.
- One server process can serve many users or apps. stdio is usually one client vs. one subprocess.

- authentication: over the network, “anyone who can hit the URL” could call our tools (checkout, add_to_cart, etc.). OAuth gives us additional authentication and validation tools my checking identity, limiting access and controlling token lifecycle. 

## Activity 1: Extend the MCP Server

Add at least one new tool to the cat shop MCP server (e.g., `search_products`, `update_cart_quantity`, or `get_order_history`). Ensure the new tool integrates properly with the existing database and OAuth authentication. Demo the new tool through an MCP client and include it in your Loom video.

## Advanced Activity: Build a Custom MCP Client

Build a custom MCP client that connects to the cat shop server over Streamable HTTP, authenticates via OAuth, and orchestrates a multi-step shopping flow (browse → add to cart → checkout). Compare the developer experience of MCP-based tool integration vs. traditional REST API calls.

Include your findings and a demo in your Loom video.
